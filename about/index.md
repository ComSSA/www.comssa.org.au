title: About ComSSA
---

For as long as Curtin University has had a computer science course, ComSSA has
been the second family to many computing students and enthusiasts alike.

Our aim is to foster a thriving community of future and active computing
professionals, provide a place for like-minded members to study, connect, and
enjoy university life, and represent students in any issues they may have with
the Department of Computing or the university as a whole.

Our [constitution] outlines the rules by which ComSSA runs, and feel free to read through any of our [meeting minutes][minutes].
